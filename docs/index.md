> Clear reminder if the call was Inbound, or Outbound;
* Never forget an End of Call Survey again. ðŸ˜¤ðŸ¤¦
> DocuHound;
* Telling the pack leader what files to look for and what domain, he will sniff out the sitemap or internal pages, and assign a hound to each page, running over the entire site to sniff out and return a list of documents found
* Downloading these files will create a new folder in your Downloads directory(the PCs default location) and make a new folder named after the domain, creating all of the files then downloading and filling.
* This is a key feature that will allow for the agents to clearly see a file with 0kb or empty was linked, but not there (missing file or 404 error), no more missed or overlooked files
