## **Key Features:**

### DNS Panel (Main UI);
<a href="https://glabay.github.io/Little-Blue-Buddy-LilBlu/dns-details" target="_blank">DNS Panel details</a>

> Using the WhoIs API, fetch and collect the DNS records from the given Domain.
> These Records are the Main Exchange Servers, Name Server, and more data for a fast check with the Customer while on the Welcome Call to ensure whether we must have a chat with our customer about the potential of service interruptions with their mail services
>
> Clear reminder if the call was inbound or Outbound
> - Never forget an End of Call Survey again.
>
> Always ready notepad that will scroll

### Social Presence;
> Check the domain for any Social Media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, Reddit, Soundcloud, Spotify, etc...)

### DocuHound;
> Take a look for the Site Map of a provided domain
> - Taking note of the URI to each page, we will assign one hound per page to sniff out any and all documents that fit the provided requirement.
> - From the hunt, the hounds will report the document links to the pack leader, who; when completed, will update the window with the final report.
> - When the user clicks to download the documents, we create a folder inside the user's download directory.
> - - The Pack Leader will assign one hound to fetch and download 16 files. anything remaining will have another hound pick up the slack.
> - - Creating the document first, and then filling it with data allows for the clear view that if the file is empty, we have to ask the customer for the file; avoiding a Production Hold.
> - This is a key feature that will help agents not miss or overlook files

### Document Renaming;
> Rename multiple images for a gallery in 3 seconds flat (or any other document type)
> Use a predefined prefix, or enter your own before submitting

### Exception emailing;
> As soon as you open the window the date and time are autofilled; easy tracking of your time, forget to enter a finish time? Not a problem, it will fill it in when you hit send. That will email off to the right depot/distro in the correct/expected template

### Templates;
> doing a follow-up, scheduling a callback? most of the redundant information will auto-populate then you only have to worry about the reason, then click to have the expected template copied to your Clipboard

### EcomRipper;
> When the customer has an existing Online-Store and wishes to use the products from it
> This tool will allow for the WBC Agent to copy the URI of the existing product and have the tool fetch the proper information
> - This will output the result to a proper format that is a simple click to copy and then fast pasting into Pega.
> - The result prints to a familiar output so the agents can quickly and accurately confirm prices and variants with the customer.
> - - When products have multiple options that affect the price of an item, it is very time-consuming to work that math out and capture the variants.
> - This is a key feature that will cut down the amount of time spent on the Ecomm Product module during the interview.
